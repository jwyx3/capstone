  "body": "I love this car yet unfortunately I'm finding myself only driving my partner's Prius and 2 cars in SOMA are starting to seem silly. Esp as this car I've used only about 1-2 times per month for the past 6 months. This car has been parked in an indoor garage the entire time of ownership.  My mom was the original owner, and then she gave it to me a few years ago. Car works perfectly, rides smooth, and has only a few minor dings on the outside. I'll post some more images this weekend.",
